## React Projects Starter APP

### Reusable Card Component

This component shows a list of cards one below the other.

Each card contains an image, title, price description and a button.

Right now it's using a public API that shows tours, however it's a boiler plate you can display any other information.

It's separated into a Tours component which uses .map to iterate over the list of objects in the API.

And a Tour component that receives the props and displays them.

Anyway you can make all the changes you need the code is rather simple, but is more to show the organization you may have.

Have fun with it.
